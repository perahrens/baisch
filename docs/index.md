# Game Instructions

## Preparation

The game components include a complete deck of 52 cards and three Jokers. 
Additionally, chess pieces are required, and their attributes are described in the Heroes section.

At the beginning of the game, each player receives eight cards. Then each player:
- selects two cards to be thrown on the graveyard
- selects one card as to be his King card
- selects up to three defense cards
- the remaining cards are kept as hand cards

Now, a card is placed face up in the middle of the playing field. 
Another card is placed face down on top of it, so that the lower card is still visible. 
This process is repeated, creating two stacks, each consisting of two cards in the middle of the playing field. 
These two stacks are referred to as the Harvest stacks. The stack with the remaining cards is placed beside them.

Next, a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors is played. The first winner then selects one of the twelve heroes for each opponent. 
Then, the next winner chooses one of the remaining heroes for each opponent. This continues until each player has two heroes. 
The first winner now designates a person to start the game. From there, the game proceeds clockwise.
